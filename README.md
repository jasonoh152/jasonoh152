## üöÄ Projects

### ML&AI:

- **[Spare-it](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jasonoh/spare-it)**: In the Spare-it project, my task was to build an image classification model to identify recyclables for [Spare-it company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spareit/). Link to our [repository](https://github.com/BU-Spark/ml-spare-it-contamination/tree/dev).
- **[MyGenAI](https://jasonoh-genai.azurewebsites.net/)**: Hosted with GitHub Actions and deployed to Azure Web App from a private repository. The description is available on the page. Mainly used LangChain and Streamlit.
- **[Audio CNN Project](https://github.com/jasonoh1998/audio-cnn-project)**: Specializing in audio data analysis, I focused on the application of spectrograms, mel-spectrograms, and MFCCs for gender and age detection. This initiative achieved high accuracy in gender identification and continues to improve age estimation.

### Full-stack Web/App Projects:

- **[BadLandLords](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-bad-landlords/tree/dev)**: As the full-stack developer, I crafted scripts for automatic database updates through web scraping and APIs, utilizing TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, GitHub Actions, Vercel, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Collaborating closely with a dedicated design team, we translated requirements from the Boston Council into a functional and user-friendly product, enhancing tenant access to information about responsible landlords. My role was pivotal in ensuring the seamless integration of design and development, aligning closely with the project's goals.
- **[D7](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-d7-dashboard)**: In this project aimed at enhancing community services in Boston's District 7, I spearheaded the development using Vite.js, Strapi, Firebase, Netlify, and GitHub Actions. My contributions included extensive refactoring for efficiency improvements and the integration of new features, alongside accurate API implementations. I worked closely with Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson, ensuring the project's alignment with community needs.
- **[Shine-AI](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-shine-ai)**: Focused on mental health support, I led the development of an application using Next.js, Prisma, Firebase, Vercel, and Jest. My role involved designing backend services and integrating external support mechanisms to create a direct pathway for users seeking professional help.
- **[Swan Stream](https://github.com/jasonoh1998/swan_stream)**: For this streaming service, I utilized JSP, Bootstrap, jQuery, Java, Spring, MyBatis, JSTL, and OracleDB, deploying it on AWS to create a robust platform for drama and comics.
